This repository contains the [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) implementation for [Digilent Nexys A7-100T](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/start) board.

The game logic is implemented on a [Microblaze](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/microblaze.html) core in C, using the FPGA for keyboard input and VGA output (mostly in VHDL).

The game was implemented as a final project assignment of the [Logtel FPGAXpert](https://www.logtel.com/training/fpgaxpert/) course.
